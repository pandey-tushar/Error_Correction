# Error_Correction
Codes for error correction and mitigation

1. The first code is a Toric Code with demonstration about excitations and logical operators. Inspired by @misc{ChristinaLee2022,
      title = "Modeling the toric code on a quantum computer",
      author = "Christina Lee",
      year = "2022",
      month = "08",
      journal = "PennyLane Demos",
      publisher = "Xanadu",
      howpublished = "\url{https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_toric_code/}",
      note = "Date Accessed: 2024-03-14"
    }

2. The second code is Zero Noise Extrapolation demonstrated by scratch using Cirq. Inspired by Mitiq - https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide/zne-5-theory.html
